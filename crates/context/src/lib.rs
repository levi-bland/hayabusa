/// Trait for types that can be constructed from a sequence of account views.
///
/// This is the core abstraction for account deserialization in Hayabusa. Types implementing
/// this trait can be automatically constructed from the accounts passed to an instruction.
///
/// # Implementation
/// Typically derived via `#[derive(FromAccountViews)]` rather than implemented manually.
/// The derive macro generates code that calls `next()` on the iterator for each field
/// in declaration order.
///
/// # Example
/// ```ignore
/// #[derive(FromAccountViews)]
/// pub struct Transfer<'ix> {
///     pub signer: Signer<'ix>,
///     pub from: TokenAccount<'ix>,
///     pub to: TokenAccount<'ix>,
/// }
/// ```
///
/// # Performance
/// Implementations should be `#[inline(always)]` to allow the optimizer to see through
/// the abstraction and generate optimal code.

    fn try_from_account_views(cursor: &mut AccountCursor<'ix>, data: &Self::IxData)
        -> Result<Self>;
}

/// Instruction context containing validated accounts and any remaining unparsed accounts.
///
/// This is the primary way to access accounts in an instruction handler. The `Ctx` type
/// ensures that:
/// - All required accounts have been validated and deserialized
/// - Remaining accounts are available for dynamic or optional account access
/// - Account lifetimes are properly tied to the instruction execution
///
/// # Type Parameter
/// - `T`: The account struct type (e.g., `Transfer<'ix>`, `Borrow<'ix>`)
///
/// # Lifetime
/// The `'ix` lifetime represents the instruction execution scope and ensures all
/// account references remain valid throughout the instruction.
///
/// # Example
/// ```ignore
/// pub fn transfer<'ix>(ctx: Ctx<'ix, Transfer<'ix>>, amount: u64) -> Result<()> {
///     // Access validated accounts
///     let from = &ctx.accounts.from;
///     let to = &ctx.accounts.to;
